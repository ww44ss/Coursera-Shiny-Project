Coursera-Shiny-Project
======================

Project for Data Products class on Coursera

##About
This is the project for the Coursera Class on Data Products.

##What it does
This is a very simple program which just barely demonstrates the capability of shiny.
Sadly it is much more modest than I had planned, but just ran out of time to debug...

##What you need
Almost nothing.
It loads mtcars and does a very simple modeling and analysis.
